# odin-recipes

This is the first project of The Odin Project Foundation curriculum.
The goal is to put together a recipe website using what has been learn so far. 
Including lists (<ol>/<ul>), images and anchors to link to the various html documents for the recipes.

I'll try to use also some CSS that I've learned before-hand.
