            <span class="science">scientific</span>
            <span class="question">ally questionable</span> recipe collection, where we turn trash into "wellness treasure" with the magical power of creative naming! Our PhD-level experts in BS nutrition have developed foolproof methods for disguising your worst dietary decisions as Instagram-worthy superfoods. Learn to transform gas station nachos into "Mediterranean quinoa bowls" (just add one chickpea!), or discover how calling french fries "golden turmeric root vegetables" makes them basically medicine. We'll teach you advanced techniques like the "kale garnish loophole" and the "coconut oil makes everything paleo" principle.</p>
